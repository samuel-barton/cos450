thread.c 

  /* list that holds threads that have been put to sleep */ 
  static struct list sleep_list;

thread.h : 

  /* part of struct thread; sleep list element */ 
  struct list_elem sleep_elem;              

  /* Tick to wake up on. if (timer_tickes == thread->wakeup_tick) the thread is woke up */
  uint64_t wakeup_tick;



---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

Here is an explanation of the flow of operations when timer_sleep() is called: 

timer_sleep (int64_t ticks) :
  -parameter represents how many ticks the thread should be asleep
  -assert that interrupts are on
  -check to make sure that ticks are >= 0
  -calculates wakeup_tick by adding ticks to the current tick (timer_ticks())
  -calls new thread_sleep method in thread.c that takes wakeup_tick as a parameter
thread_sleep(int64_t wakeup_ticks) : 
  -sets 0 as a minimum value for wakeup_ticks (in other words, if <= 0 wake up immediately)
  -set the wakeup_tick value of the running thread to the parameter
  -disable interrupts
  -insert running thread into sleeping list by wakeup_tick in ascending order
  -block the running thread by calling thread_block() method
  -enable interrupts 
thread_block() : 
  -assert that interrupts are off
  -set status of running thread to THREAD_BLOCKED
  -call schedule() method to start running next thread 

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

  We minimize the time spent with interrupts disabled, and we only use one time-consuming operation,
namely the list_insert_ordered on our wait list.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

  The timer_sleep() method quickly calculates the ticks to wake up on and passes that to thread_sleep(),
which promptly disables interrupts before it inserts the running thread in the sleep list and blocks the thread.
Interrupts should be disabled during the insertion into lists as well as when you are switching running threads, 
which is a direct result of blocking the running thread. 


>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

  Race conditions are avoided by use of enabling and disabling interrupts. When manipulating a list, interrupts are
disabled so a thread finishes the manipulation before any interrupt can occur that may require use of the same list. 
Additionally, interrupts are disabled when switching running threads to minimize cpu idle time. 


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

  We chose this design as it is efficient and minimizes the time that interrupts are disabled. Our initial 
implementation attempted to solve this problem without disabling interrupts at all which lead to race issues. Our
second implementation was too cavalier with interrupts are was inefficient. We found a middle ground which both ensured
that our data was processed in the order we intended and was reasonably efficient.

The waitlist for locks, semaphores, and condition variables is sorted by 
priority.

lock_acquire calls the thread_donate_priority() function passing it a
reference to the thread holding the lock.

thread_donate_priority() then adds the current thread to the list of 
threads which have donated their priority to the locks holder.

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

  The ambiguity was discovered of what to do when priorities are equal. The table follows the same logic of what 
we used in the scheduler. 
  We test if the current thread has a priority that is lower than the next. In turn, we do not switch threads
when they are equal. If instead we tested for less than or equal the new thread would switch over in a tie. 

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

  As with the other portions of the project, we aim to disable interrupts for the shortest time possible to
increase efficiency. The more often that ticks occur the faster the process can execute its intent. Consequently,
the more lines of code that you have interrupts disabled the more you slow down the overall execution. For instance,
we check to see if we need to run methods outside of the context, and if it is determined that we do need to call a 
method that requires interrupts be disabled, we do so within that method.

  Given the nature of the testing routines, on every interrupt we need to check if thread_mlfqs is true. This is only
one check but it is run so often that the overhead is notable. An alternate strategy would be to have different methods
for interrupts depending on which scheduler you are using. 
  Additionally, the value for the number of threads currently ready didn't need to be a static variable as it could 
have been calculated on the fly when you calculate load average. This was done intentionally for modularity and 
debugging purposes.
  If we had more time to improve the design, one aspect would be to streamline more of the fixed point operations. A lot
of the functionality needed we nest together these statements, where functions that combine the operations would improve 
efficiency.

  All of the fixed point arithmetic is contained in fixed-point.h within the threads directory. It made sense for us to
isolate the functionality in its own structure as it may need to be reused in other portions of the project. It is rare 
to find a math library of functionality defined within the context of a program, as it makes more sense to import math 
functions rather than redefine them.
